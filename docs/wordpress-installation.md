# WordPress installation 

[Download](https://wordpress.org/download/) and unzip the WordPress package if you havenâ€™t already.
Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a [MySQL](http://codex.wordpress.org/Glossary#MySQL) user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.

Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server.

If you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain e.g. ```https://www.example.com```, move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPress directory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.
