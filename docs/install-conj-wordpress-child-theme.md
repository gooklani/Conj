# Install and activate child theme 

If you want to customize the theme at coding level, not just CSS, we would strongly suggest using a child theme for that. A child theme allows you to override the parent theme's functions, template files and CSS so you will be able to adjust them as you want.

!> Here is the thing that causes the most confusion: **You don't always need a child theme**.

* Edit the theme's CSS stylesheet.
* Edit any of the theme's PHP templates.
* Edit the theme's ```functions.php``` file. Even just to add a single line of code.
* Modify any of the theme's assets stored in the theme folder â€” including javascript files and images.

If you answered **Yes** to any of these questions, you need a child theme.
